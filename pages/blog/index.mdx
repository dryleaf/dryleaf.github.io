# Hi!

When I thought about creating a blog, I didn't think what I should write about, so I have no clew what I'm doing.
<br/>
<br/>
<div style={{maxWidth: '350px'}}>
<img title="Josimar using a smartphone | Art credits by Cosmo, a Yokohama artist painter" src="/blog/dryleaf-clewless.jpg" alt="dryleaf clewless" style={{frameBorder:'0', width: '100%', height: '100%'}}/>
<span style={{display: 'block', fontSize: '12px', marginTop: '-1.5rem', textAlign: 'center'}}>Art credits by Cosmo, a Yokohama artist painter</span>
</div>


Therefore, most of the topics that pop up in this blog will be completely random, based on what I'm interested in at that particular time.


## Featured Topics

**Adjacency Map Graph**
<p>
In an Adjacency Map Graph, each vertex also holds the edges incident to it and the arrows exiting it in a separate collection.
An Adjacency Map Graph can be `directed` or `undirected`, and edges can be `weighted` or `unweighted`.
