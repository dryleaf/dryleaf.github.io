            <p>The dryleaf.io is a privately owned website that contains a portfolio, photographs, blog, contacts and other digital resources.</p>
            <p>The information provided below constitutes a general privacy policy that covers the dryleaf.io operations involving the collection, use, disclosure, and other processing of personal information on websites, when hosting contents and managing relationships with the advertising community and public, when interacting with:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>visitors to its websites (“Visitors”).</li>
              <li>registered dryleaf.io members (“Members”).</li>
              <li>individuals who register for our programming and events, or who request to receive information or resources (“Registrants”).</li>
              <li>individuals outside dryleaf.io involved in the public debate concerning digital content creation including members of the press, with whom dryleaf.io may interact and whose personal information it processes (“Stakeholders”).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>At dryleaf.io we are committed to being clear and transparent about how we process personal information. We will not collect more personal information than is needed to accomplish the purposes described in this privacy policy, and will not retain any personal information collected longer than is necessary to fulfill those purposes.</p>
            <p>Information pertaining to a device or an individual may be considered personal information in certain jurisdictions. As a part of dryleaf.io's commitment to transparency and consumer education we fully comply with the EU user consent policy and use the terms and definitions from the 2020 NAI Code of Conduct (“Code”) to help explain how we collect, use and share different types of personal information.</p>
            <h4>Terminology for Types of Data</h4>
            <p style={{fontStyle: 'italic'}}>Device Identified Information</p>
            <p>Device-Identified Information (DII) is any data that is linked to a particular browser or device if that data is not used, or intended to be used, to directly identify a particular individual. DII may include, but is not limited to, unique identifiers associated with browsers or devices, such as cookie identifiers or advertising identifiers, and IP addresses, where such data is not linked or intended to be linked to PII. DII includes data that is linked to a series of browsers or devices linked through Cross-Device Linking, if that data is not used, or intended to be used, to directly identify a particular individual.</p>
            <p style={{fontStyle: 'italic'}}>Personally Identified Information</p>
            <p>Personally-Identified Information (PII) is any data linked, or intended to be linked, to an identified individual, including name, address, telephone number, email address, financial account number, and non-publicly available government-issued identifier.</p>
            <h4>Terminology for Types of Technology</h4>
            <p style={{fontStyle: 'italic'}}>Cookies</p>
            <p>A cookie is information (a small text file) that a site saves to your web browser. Cookies enable customization of your web experiences. For example, a cookie may allow sites to recognize the same browser as it navigates through pages and content, when it visited, and whether it clicked on an ad. Cookies can help sites remember items in your shopping cart, your log-in name, or your high game scores. Cookies are typically exceedingly small (less than the size of a file containing a sentence or two) and take virtually no space on or slow down your browser.</p>
            <p style={{fontStyle: 'italic'}}>Non-Cookie Technology</p>
            <p>Non-Cookie Technology is a method for the collection and use of data for digital advertising often used in cases where a cookie cannot be placed on a user's browser. These technologies often include browser cache, locally stored objects, or statistical identifiers. This technique is often employed because a browser's settings currently have cookies blocked, either by default or by the user's own choice. This method can take several different forms. Often it entails the creation of a statistical identifier wherein an identifier, much like a cookie identifier, is calculated based on the characteristics of a browser or device that distinguishes it from other browsers or devices. These identifiers are calculated either from the data your browser or device shares automatically or with additional data specifically requested from your browser or device.</p>
