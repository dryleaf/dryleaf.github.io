# Philosophy of life

Epictetus, Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, and all the other great stoics of that generation have left us some guiding principles and virtues to live life by. Here are some of them summarized:

*Some things are under your direct control and other things not. You're mindful of this distinction throughout the day, especially when faced with challenging situations. You calmly and rationally accept that external events sometimes do not turn out as you may have wished.*

*The most important thing in life is the quality of your own actions, that they should be wise and good, healthy and honourable in your own eyes. Peace of mind comes from abandoning fears and desires about things outside your control.*

*You can rationally that things go one way or another without demanding that they do so, or becoming upsetif they do not. You'e prepared to face either success or failure with equal calm and serenity.*

*Challenging situations don't have to make you distressed. Dwelling on unhealthy feelings such as excessive anger, increasingly seems pointless and unnecessary. You can take a stand against things and assert yourself without becoming upset.*

*You love wisdom, truth and understanding. You seek to group your own nature and that of the world around you. Your true values are becoming clearer to you and your actions more consistent with them.*

*You love virtue, excellence and strength of character. You admire positive traits in others like wisdom, justice, courage and self-discipline, and you seek day by day to cultivate these virtues in your own life.*

*You view strength of character as the basis of true fulfilment in life. A good person can have a good life, even when facing difficult circumstances. It's your attitude toward life that determines whether it's good or bad.*

*Other people's opinions are far less important to you than your own sense of what's wise or foolish, right or wrong. Health, wealth and reputation may sometimes be preferable in life, but they're not necessary to excel and flourish as a human being.*

*You dare to be wise. You dedicate each moment of the day to improve*
